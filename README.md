Simulations for MEDAL (back pain analgesic) trial

This repository contains the files for the simulations that were run to evaluate the sample size and design operating characteristics for the MEDAL trial Bayesian adaptive design.

The FACTS file MEDAL_TTE_1320.facts contains the specificaion of the simulations.  This is described in the file MEDAL_design_report.  Version 1.1 is the latest; this corrected some errors in version 1.0 and added further operating characteristics.  Further version of this design report will be added as work is completed.

Apologies the initial commit included the wrong version of the design report v1.0; if anyone looked at this it would not have made a lot of sense.  My error uploading the wrong file!
